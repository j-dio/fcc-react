/**
So, if your custom hook…

    fetches data, you can call it useFetch

    toggles something on and off, you can call it useToggle

    or if it implements debouncing, useDebounce is a good name

Let's say you want to build a custom hook to add debouncing to your app.

Debouncing is a programming technique that limits how often a function runs. It works by waiting until a user stops performing an action for a specified period of time before executing the function. 

For example, in a search box, instead of making an API call for every keystroke, debouncing waits until the user pauses typing for, say, 500 milliseconds.
